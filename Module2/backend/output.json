    "classification_reasoning": "The information provided details characteristics, history, and operational aspects of 'Cat News,' which is explicitly stated as 'the IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group's newsletter.' To verify any aspect of this information—such as its publication history, content, editorial processes, availability, ordering details, or author guidelines—one would primarily consult the official website, publications, or statements of the IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, an organizational source. While specific facts like the publication year (1984), page length, and peer-review process have an objective, historical, or scientific nature (STEM), their verification ultimately relies on the official records and communications provided by the managing organization. Therefore, Organization is the dominant verification category.",
