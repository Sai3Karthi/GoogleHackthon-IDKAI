    "classification_reasoning": "The primary verification method for this news would involve official communications and records from ISRO and the Indian Navy, making 'Organization' the dominant category. Many facts, such as satellite weight, rocket type, and orbital mechanics, are objective data points verifiable through 'STEM' principles and historical records. The article explicitly mentions and links to ISRO's official content on social media platforms (YouTube, X/Twitter), necessitating 'Social' media verification to confirm the authenticity of these posts. Quotes from the ISRO chairman require 'Person' verification of his specific statements, though this is a minor part of the overall event. 'Critical' verification is not relevant as this is a planned space launch, not an emergency.",

    "comprehensive_summary": "On November 2, 2025, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the GSAT-7R, also known as CMS-03, which is the Indian Navy’s most advanced communication satellite. The launch took place at approximately 5:26 p.m. IST from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, utilizing ISRO’s powerful LVM3 launch vehicle on its M5 mission. This indigenously designed and developed satellite is significant for weighing approximately 4,400 kg, making it India’s heaviest communication satellite to date launched from Indian soil. Following its successful liftoff, the satellite was inserted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), from which it will use its onboard propulsion systems to raise and circularize its final operational orbit. Equipped with state-of-the-art indigenous components, the GSAT-7R is poised to provide robust and secure telecommunication coverage across the Indian Ocean Region for the Navy, featuring an advanced payload with transponders supporting voice, data, and video links over multiple communication bands, thus ensuring seamless connectivity between naval ships, submarines, aircraft, and Maritime Operations Centres. This mission marks a major milestone in strengthening the Navy’s space-based communications and maritime domain awareness, underscoring India’s growing self-reliance, or Aatmanirbhar Bharat, in space technology and its commitment to safeguarding national maritime interests by enabling armed forces to operate with enhanced situational awareness and secure, high-capacity communication links. Furthermore, the launch demonstrated the LVM3 rocket's proven capacity to routinely handle four-tonne-plus satellites to GTO from India, thereby reducing dependence on foreign launchers for heavy communication satellites, and directly feeding into ISRO’s preparations for Gaganyaan, its maiden human spaceflight programme, which plans to use an evolved LVM3 variant. ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan affirmed the success, highlighting the Indian space sector's ascent in providing valuable services to the user community in and around the Indian region.",
