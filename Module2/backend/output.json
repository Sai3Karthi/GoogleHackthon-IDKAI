    "classification_reasoning": "The allegations center around voter fraud, manipulation of electoral rolls, and the use of automated software. Verifying these claims primarily requires official records, investigations, and statements from the Election Commission (EC), local government offices (tehsildar), and police departments (for FIRs), which fall under 'Organization'. Additionally, the claims of manipulated electoral rolls and 'automated software' necessitate detailed data analysis, statistical anomaly detection, and potential forensic examination of systems, which are 'STEM' verification methods. While individuals make various statements, the truth of their claims relies on the evidence held and investigated by these organizations and through scientific data analysis. Social and Critical verification categories are not directly applicable to confirming the veracity of these specific claims.",

    "comprehensive_summary": "On September 19, 2025, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi initiated a new controversy by alleging widespread voter fraud in Maharashtra and Karnataka, claiming an automated software was used to manipulate electoral rolls through unauthorized additions in constituencies like Rajura (Maharashtra) and deletions in Aland (Karnataka). Gandhi further charged that this software had been deployed in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, and was currently being used in Bihar. Subhash Dhote, the Congress candidate for Rajura, stated he lost the assembly polls by 3,054 votes to the BJP's Deorao Bhongle due to this rigging, a stark contrast to the Congress's significant lead of 58,349 votes in the Rajura segment during the earlier Chandrapur Lok Sabha elections, which Pratibha Dhanorkar won by 260,000 votes. Dhote claimed to have lodged a formal complaint with the Election Commission (EC) about fraudulent entries, which were subsequently deleted, and an FIR was filed by the tehsildar; however, the EC has reportedly refused to share details of those involved in the alleged scam with the police, despite Dhote's appeals to the district collector and Superintendent of Police. Conversely, Bhongle asserted that he was the one who complained to the EC about suspected bogus names during the revision of electoral rolls prior to the elections, leading to the rejection of many applications and preventing names from being added as claimed by Gandhi, adding that the addition of 10,600 new voters across 344 booths was normal. Supporting Gandhi's claims, Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe alleged that approximately 55,000 new voters were added to the Chandrapur Lok Sabha seat within five months, specifically identifying 11,667 bogus online registrations between October 1 and 15, 2024, which were deleted after their complaint, though demands for associated IP addresses, email IDs, and mobile numbers remain unfulfilled. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant echoed these concerns, suggesting the EC's refusal to share CCTV footage from voting centers validated Gandhi's accusations and questioned the EC's integrity. In staunch opposition, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis (BJP) labeled Gandhi a 'serial liar,' citing the EC's rejection of Gandhi’s 'expose' as proof and arguing that the allegations stemmed from the Congress's defeat in Maharashtra. Fadnavis also noted that Gandhi had not provided any evidence to the EC or the court despite receiving notices, branding this as an insult to India’s Constitution and judiciary. State NCP president Sunil Tatkare also dismissed the charges as 'childish,' expressing confidence in voters' ability to understand the 'narrative' being advanced by the Congress leader and the INDIA bloc.",
