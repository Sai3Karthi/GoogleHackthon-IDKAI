The liftoff took place at about 5:26 p.m. IST from the second launch pad, and mission control soon confirmed that the satellite had been successfully inserted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO).\n\nThis is the heaviest Indian-built communications satellite launched from Indian soil so far. Because of the high mass of the GSAT-7R, the launch vehicle targeted a standard GTO; once there, the satellite will raise and circularise its orbit using its onboard propulsion systems.\n\nLiftoff! #LVM3M5 launches #CMS03 from SDSC SHAR, carrying India's heaviest communication satellite to GTO.\n\nYoutube URL:https://t.co/gFKB0A1GJE\n\nFor more Information Visithttps://t.co/yfpU5OTEc5\n\n— ISRO (@isro) November 2, 2025\nNaval communications\nThe Indian Navy said that, equipped with state-of-the-art indigenous components, the GSAT-7R will provide robust and secure telecommunication coverage across the Indian Ocean Region. Its advanced payload features transponders supporting voice, data, and video links over multiple communication bands, ensuring seamless connectivity between the Navy’s ships, submarines, aircraft, and Maritime Operations Centres.\n\nThe successful launch of the GSAT-7R highlights India’s growing self-reliance in space technology and the Navy’s commitment to safeguarding national maritime interests, it said. It stands as a testament to Aatmanirbhar Bharat, enabling the armed forces to operate with enhanced situational awareness and secure, high-capacity communication links in complex maritime environments, it added.\n\nPreparing for Gaganyaan\nThe launch also demonstrated the capacity of the LVM3 rocket to routinely handle four-tonne-plus satellites to GTO from India, reducing dependence on foreign launchers for heavy communications satellites as well as feeding directly into ISRO’s preparations for Gaganyaan, its maiden human spaceflight programme, which plans to use an evolved LVM3 variant.\n\n“ISRO has successfully launched the heaviest GEO communication satellite from Indian soil,” ISRO chairman V. Narayanan posted on X following the successful launch. “The Indian space sector is soaring high to provide valuable services to the user community in and around the Indian region,” he added.",
