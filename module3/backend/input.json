  "text": "Charles James Kirk (October 14, 1993 – September 10, 2025) was an American right-wing political activist, entrepreneur, and media personality who rose to prominence as a leading voice in the MAGA movement. Born in Arlington Heights, Illinois, he dedicated himself to political activism after a brief stint at Harper College. Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA) in 2012 and served as its executive director, establishing the organization as a significant force in conservative youth activism. He employed strategies such as the “Prove Me Wrong” table debates, the Professor Watchlist, and large-scale rallies to engage young voters. TPUSA expanded under his leadership, creating affiliate groups like Turning Point Action and Turning Point Faith, the latter a partnership with Pastor Rob McCoy focused on mobilizing religious communities around conservative causes. This led to Kirk becoming associated with Christian nationalism. A vocal supporter of Donald Trump, Kirk advocated for conservative positions, including opposition to abortion, gun control, DEI programs, and LGBT rights. His views also included criticisms of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Martin Luther King Jr., alongside the promotion of COVID-19 misinformation, false claims regarding the 2020 election, and the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. He authored several books and hosted the talk radio program, *The Charlie Kirk Show*. Kirk was married to Erika Frantzve in 2021, and they had two children. Tragically, at the age of 31, Kirk was assassinated by gunshot on September 10, 2025, while speaking at a TPUSA debate at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. His assassination garnered international attention and widespread condemnation of political violence. Donald Trump announced that Kirk would be honored posthumously. Since his death, Kirk has been considered an icon of contemporary conservatism.",
