Obituary: Bruce Robertson , who has died aged 79, was managing director of the book design and artwork partnership Diagram and founder of the Diagram Prize for the Oddest Book Title, an award presented annually by The Bookseller magazine. Robertson and his business partner Trevor Bounford dreamed up the award in 1978 to avoid boredom at the annual Frankfurt Book Fair. The first award went to Proceedings Of The Second International Workshop On Nude Mice. Other winners over the years have included How to Avoid Huge Ships; Goblinproofing One’s Chicken Coop; and Managing a Dental Practice the Genghis Khan Way. The Diagram Prize (which earns the winner a passable bottle of claret and — possibly — a boost in sales) is unique in that spotters and judges do not actually have to read the books in question. Indeed, they are actively discouraged from doing so, in case a close knowledge of the subject leads them to conclude that the titles are less odd than they first appear. The prize grabbed the imagination of the Press and, indeed, became so high-profile that in 2004 the organisers complained that some publishers were self-consciously choosing titles with a view to winning it, “presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories”. There have also been moments of nail-biting controversy. In 1999, for example, Male Genitalia of Butterflies of the Balkan Peninsula, with a Checklist, was a favourite to win — until it was rejected for being deliberately boring. The competition was initially decided by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been chosen by a public vote on The Bookseller’s website — a development that has led to complaints of dumbing down and vulgarity (as seen in the controversial winner of the 2007 award, If You Want Closure In Your Relationship, Start With Your Legs). However, it should perhaps be noted that the 2011 winner, Cooking with Poo, is, in fact, a manual about how to create Thai dishes with crab. With his shaggy beard, Union flag ties and black beret, Robertson cut a colourful figure on the book fair scene. His company, which specialises in book packaging and graphics, had little opportunity to enter the competition in its own right. However, Robertson was particularly proud to have been involved in the publication of a Japanese edition of Woman’s Body: An Owner’s Manual — in Braille complete with charts, “thus enabling blind Japanese women to know what goes on in their bodies”, as he put it. Bruce Robertson was born in Sunderland, then part of Co Durham (now Tyne and Wear) on December 8 1934. His father, Fred, was the manager of a Co-Op store and his mother, Ivy, a cook in a local school. After Hylton Road School and Sunderland Technical College for Boys, Bruce took up an apprenticeship at a local architectural practice. He proved so skilled at drawing that the owner of the practice suggested to his parents that he attend art school. Eventually, after two years’ National Service in the Army, he took up a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. Having graduated, Robertson worked for several publishing houses, including Penguin and Aldus Books, doing graphic and book jacket design. He then held a teaching post at Chelsea School of Art and in 1960, with Bob Chapman, founded Diagram. Over the next 50 years the company grew to be a successful book packager, providing graphic and other material for some 270 publishers around the world. The most recent Diagram Prize, the 36th, was, by coincidence, presented on the day of Robertson’s death. Continuing to mine a well-worn scatological seam, the prize went to How to Poo on a Date, by Mats and Enzo, a manual for dealing with calls of nature during romantic nights out. Bruce Robertson is survived by his wife, Patricia, whom he married in 1959, and by their two sons and two daughters, Bruce Robertson, born December 8 1934, died March 21 2014 Guardian: In 1968 I was a young journalist on Business Management. For an article about management practices I interviewed Tony Benn, then minister of technology, on the “brain drain”. I was given the prize possession of our office – the tape-recorder. Apart from the on/off switch, I had no idea how it worked, but it was a better bet than my unreadable shorthand. I waited nervously on the 11th floor of Millbank Tower. He greeted me warmly, holding his trademark pint-sized mug of tea, and patiently answered my questions. Half-way through,"
