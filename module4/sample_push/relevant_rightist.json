Photograph: I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty Images Donald Trump Agence France-Press in Washington Mon 20 Oct 2025 18.51 BST Last modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 02.59 BST Share Donald Trump has expressed doubt on Monday that would invade Taiwan as he voiced confidence in his relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, whom he will meet later this month. “I think we’ll be just fine with China. China doesn’t want to do that,” Trump told reporters as he met the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Speaking of Xi’s designs on Taiwan, Trump said: “Now that doesn’t mean it’s not the apple of his eye, because probably it is, but I don’t see anything happening.” Without explicitly saying he would authorize force to defend Taiwan, Trump said that China knows that the United States “is the strongest military power in the world by far”. Tension haunts tiny Taiwanese isles that live in fear of war with China Read more Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden repeatedly suggested he would order the US military to intervene if China moved on Taiwan.
