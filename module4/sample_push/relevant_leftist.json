          "extracted_content": "COMMENTARY Why ‘Strategic Ambiguity’ Trumps ‘Strategic Clarity’ on Taiwan Michael Clarke and Matthew Sussex 24 November 2021 9 Minute Read Arleigh-burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd transits the Taiwan Strait on 27 August 2021. Courtesy of US Department of Defense When saying less about the defence of Taiwan is more. Asked during a ‘town hall’ event in Baltimore on 22 October whether the US would defend Taiwan if it was attacked by China, US President Joe Biden stated, ‘Yes, we have a commitment to do that’. Some see this as a welcome step to frame US policy vis-à-vis Taiwan through ‘strategic clarity’ rather than the ‘strategic ambiguity’ that has defined it for decades. For others, however, ‘strategic clarity’ is unnecessarily provocative, as it would effectively extend a security guarantee over a territory that Beijing views as an ‘integral’ part of the ‘motherland’, and militarily unsound given wargaming that shows US forces suffering significant losses in a potential war over Taiwan. The crucial issue here is a disjuncture between the moral grounds for adopting less ambiguous commitments to Taiwan and the continuing strategic utility of ambiguity if the core US objective is avoiding war with China. Put simply, while a clear statement that the US is committed to the defence of Taiwan on the grounds that only the people of Taiwan should decide its future is both morally sound and politically attractive, it does not resolve the dilemma that some of its advocates believe it will – i.e., enhancing the credibility of US deterrence vis-à-vis China. This is because greater certainty regarding US intentions and ‘red lines’ is not what has kept a lid – however imperfectly – on this potential flashpoint. Rather, as Thomas Schelling observed, central to the operation of deterrence is the manipulation of risk or uncertainty. For deterrent threats to be credible, they ‘do not need to depend on a willingness to commit anything like suicide in the face of a challenge’ but rather must carry the risk that the deterrer ‘is likely to do something that is fraught with the danger of war’ through a ‘compounding of actions and reactions, calculations and miscalculations, of alarms and false alarms, of commitments and challenges’. A country, he observed, could credibly ‘threaten to stumble into a war even if it cannot credibly threaten to invite one’. ‘Strategic Ambiguity’: Flawed but Effective Despite President Biden’s assertion, it is clear that the US does not currently have a commitment to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. Since the formal normalisation of Sino-US relations in 1979, Washington’s position vis-à-vis Taiwan has been guided by the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The TRA asserted that while Washington had determined to recognise the People’s Republic of China (PRC), it is the policy of the US: To preserve and promote extensive relations with the people of Taiwan. That peace and stability in the area are in the political, security and economic interests of the US. That establishment of relations with the PRC rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means. That any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means would constitute a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and be of grave concern to the US. As a result, the TRA identifies the need ‘to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character’ and ‘to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan’. The resting of post-1979 policy on the basis of ‘strategic ambiguity’ has successfully attenuated the risk that Washington could become entrapped in a war with China over Taiwan While successive US administrations since 1979 have utilised the TRA to provide Taiwan with access to significant military capabilities, none has ever provided a definitive statement that Washington would in fact use its military ‘capacity’ to defend Taiwan. The Taiwan Strait crises of 1954–1955 and 1956–57, for instance, had demonstrated the very real risks to the US of too overt a commitment to the defence of Taiwan. The resting of post-1979 policy on the basis of ‘strategic ambiguity’ – i.e., ensuring that neither Beijing nor Taipei can be certain of US involvement in the event of a cross-Strait conflict – has successfully attenuated the risk that Washington could become entrapped in a war with China over Taiwan. The success of ‘strategic ambiguity’ has also been underpinned by the fact that for much of the time since 1979 China did not possess the military capabilities to directly or indirectly coerce Taiwan. Despite this, some administrations have come closer than others to making a break from ‘strategic ambiguity’ since 1979. For instance, in April 2001 President George W Bush asserted in the wake of his decision to approve a US$5 bi"
